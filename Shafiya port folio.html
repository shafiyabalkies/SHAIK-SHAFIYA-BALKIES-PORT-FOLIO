<P>Finally <mark>ME</mark>@ &#129313;..:-<h3 color="blue;"><em>Breafly Let's know about Me:--</h3></em></p >
<p>I'm not a One in a million kind of GIRL.. im a one of the <strong>Orthodox</strong> kind of women who need to live in a culture that values & respects & looks up to <strong>IDOLIZES WOMEN</strong> to begin new skills in relative to technologies..im very passionate abt new technologies ..listening and patience are my biggest assests..im able to acclimatize with the sutiation and cope up with team..im greedy to learn new things as though i put my 100 % effort to acheive wt i wanted to be..and i try to learn something wherever i enter in to.. Two things defines me the first is my PATIENCE when i have nothing & my ATTITUDE when i have everything..sometimes my heart needs more time to accept wt actually my mind already knows..i will good enough to forgive someone, But i wont be stupid to trust them again and again.. i always be happy infront of people who dislikes me because my happiness can kills them...if i expect others to make me happy i will always be disappointed so i wont expect anything anymore... but i always trys to be strong by fighting myself..& understanding a MISUNDERSTANDING is my big UNDERSTANDING...no one notices my sadness until it turns in to anger , and then finally i will be the BAD ONE..& When i hurt someone i say sorry 100 times ,But when someone hurts me,they behaves like nothing happend ..but however i always be single and flirting everone i like..i always be the BEST VERSION Of MYSELF..i just want Respect and Loyality from men,perhaps i can manage finance by my own...finally irealised that <mark>"THE BEST REVINGE IS MASSIVE SUCCESS...."</mark>

<p style="color:blue;"> SIMPLY THIS IS WHAT I'M ...</p>
